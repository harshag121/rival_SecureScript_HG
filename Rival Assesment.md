# Rival Assessment

# Secure Blog Platform (Public \+ Private \+ Social Feed)

---

## Objective

Build a production-ready blog platform with:

- User authentication system  
- Private dashboard  
- Public blog URLs  
- Public feed  
- Like & comment system  
- Clean frontend and backend architecture

Advanced concepts such as async jobs and rate limiting are **optional but recommended** and will be considered bonus points.

---

## Time Expectation

6--10 hours  
Focus on architecture, correctness, and clean design over UI polish.

---

# Required Stack

## Backend

- NestJS (latest stable)  
- TypeScript (strict mode)  
- PostgreSQL  
- Prisma ORM

## Frontend

- Next.js 15 (App Router)  
- TypeScript  
- Clean architecture  
- Proper authentication flow

---

# Functional Requirements

---

## Authentication System

Users must be able to:

- Register  
- Login  
- Access protected dashboard routes

Requirements:

- Password hashing (bcrypt)  
- JWT-based authentication  
- Guards for protected routes  
- Proper DTO validation  
- Secure error responses

Bonus: \- Refresh tokens \- Role-based system

---

## Blog Management (Private Dashboard)

Authenticated users can:

### Create Blog

POST /blogs

### Edit Blog

PATCH /blogs/:id

### Delete Blog

DELETE /blogs/:id

Fields: { title: string content: string isPublished: boolean }

Rules: \- Only blog owner can modify \- Proper validation \- Proper status codes \- Slug must be unique

---

## Public Blog Access

GET /public/blogs/:slug

Requirements:

- Only published blogs accessible  
- Proper 404 handling  
- Clean error responses

---

# Public Feed (Required)

Create a public feed endpoint:

GET /public/feed

Return:

- Paginated list of published blogs  
- Author basic info  
- Like count  
- Comment count  
- Publish date

Requirements:

- Pagination required  
- Sorted by newest first  
- Avoid N+1 query problem  
- Optimized Prisma queries

Frontend route: /feed

Must include: \- Loading state \- Empty state \- Pagination or infinite scroll

---

# Like System (Optional)

Authenticated users can:

POST /blogs/:id/like DELETE /blogs/:id/like

Rules:

- A user can like a post only once  
- Prevent duplicate likes (DB constraint required)  
- Must be authenticated  
- Return updated like count

---

# Comment System (Optional)

Authenticated users can:

POST /blogs/:id/comments GET /blogs/:id/comments

Comment Body: { content: string }

Requirements:

- Proper validation  
- Author info included in response  
- Sorted by newest first  
- Indexed by blogId  
- No page reload on frontend

---

# Database Requirements (Prisma)

### User

- id  
- email (unique)  
- passwordHash  
- createdAt

### Blog

- id  
- userId (relation)  
- title  
- slug (unique)  
- content  
- summary (nullable)  
- isPublished  
- createdAt  
- updatedAt

### Like

- id  
- userId  
- blogId  
- createdAt

Constraint: \- Unique (userId, blogId)

### Comment

- id  
- blogId  
- userId  
- content  
- createdAt

Indexes: \- blogId \- createdAt

---

# Optional Advanced Concepts (Bonus Points)

## 🔹 Asynchronous Job Processing

When a blog is published:

- Enqueue background job (Redis \+ BullMQ recommended)  
- Generate blog summary  
- Store summary  
- Log job status

Must not block HTTP response.

## 🔹 API Rate Limiting

Implement rate limiting for:

- Public feed  
- Blog detail endpoints  
- Authentication endpoints

Return 429 on violation.

## 🔹 Structured Logging

Use structured logging (Pino or Winston).

- API abstraction layer  
- Proper authentication handling  
- Protected routes  
- Optimistic UI updates for likes (preferred)  
- Proper loading & error states  
- No unnecessary re-renders  
- Basic responsiveness

---

# 🔐 Security Expectations

- Password hashing  
- JWT validation  
- Input validation  
- Proper status codes  
- Prevent duplicate likes  
- Prevent unauthorized edits  
- No sensitive data exposure
